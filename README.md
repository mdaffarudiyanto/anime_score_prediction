<h1>Comparing Support Vector Regression and BERT Performance for Predicting Anime Score from Key Element</h1>

The process of bringing anime to life begins with the formation of a production committee. For the production committee of anime studios to meet its objectives, the anime it produces must be able to engage the audience. This engagement can be effectively measured through ratings, which serve as a straightforward indicator of how the audience perceives the anime. However, these ratings only become available after the anime has been broadcasted, meaning that its reception can only be assessed post-production. In other words, it is challenging for the production committee to predict how well the audience will receive their proposed anime. Although analyzing current trends is a way to predict an anime's success, it has limitations as the anime industry is highly dynamic, with trends shifting unpredictably. This means relying solely on trend analysis may not always result in accurate predictions of the success of an anime.

This project aims to implement predictive models, which analyze vast amounts of data, identifying patterns and features that could indicate an anime's success. The predictive model can offer insights into audience reception even before an anime is produced by integrating factors such as synopsis, genres, studios, types, and parental ratings. This project specifically aims to build two different regression models, baseline and advanced machine learning model, to predict an anime score based on its features.The performance of these models will be evaluated using appropriate metrics, determining which model produces the best result. By adopting such predictive modeling, production committees could make more informed decisions, leading to the production of anime that resonates with audiences and achieves commercial success in the ever-evolving anime industry landscape.
